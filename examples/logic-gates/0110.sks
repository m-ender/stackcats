0110 - XOR / NOT EQUALS
=======================

The above is the only length 11 solution.

^ performs a XOR and :]< removes Q from the input stack. _ results in -1-(P^Q), and I_ moves
this negative value leftward. >[: then moves the -1 from the input stack and puts it under the
-1-(P^Q), and the ^ fixes the top of the stack back to P^Q.
