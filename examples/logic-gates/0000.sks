:!<X>!:

0000 - FALSE
============

:!<X>!:
:!>X<!:

These two use X to ignore the input, with the ! being necessary to put a -1 beneath the zero output.

+-I:I-+
+I-:-I+

These two make use of the -1 at the bottom of the input stack.

<I!+!I>

This one creates a -1 in a separate stack, uses + to pull two zeroes on top of the -1 then moves one of those zeroes away.
